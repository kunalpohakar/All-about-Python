# Ternary Operator / Conditional Expression

# Ternary operators also known as conditional expressions are operators that evaluate something based on a condition being true or false.
# It simply allows to test a condition in a single line replacing the multiline if-else making the code compact.

# Syntax :

# [on_true] if [expression] else [on_false] 


# Example.....

# supoose you want to check virat can send a msg to dhoni on Facebook but first you need to check weather they are friends or not on Facebook.

is_friend = True

is_msg = "Allow to Msg" if is_friend else "Not Allow to msg"
